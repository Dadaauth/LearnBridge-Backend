# LearnBridge
A tutorial application for kwasu students. LearnBridge means a bridge of learning between students

**NOTE:** Use Flask_SQLAlchemy for database handling instead of plain SQLAlchemy

# > Features to Implement
* Students should be able to upload documents then they can ask a reasoning engine questions. Ths will be a feature like when chatGPT is trained on web content and then the propmpters can ask it a lot of questions based on what it has been trained on. A RAG - (Retrieval Augmented Generation), a combination of a generative and retrieval model.
* You should probably implement your own streaming protocol directly from your servers instead of using cloud storage which has the extra cost of storing your files. If your cloud compute has enough space you can store your videos on it.
* Add automated practice section where students can practice what they have learned. It can be an automated marker using a complicated algorithm to mark the answers maybe using OCR image recognition or it can just be an objectives based question. There should be a variety of randomly generated questions. There should also be rankings for questions solved that can be displayed on the student's profile. This can motivate students to solve more questions and effectively become better students overall.
